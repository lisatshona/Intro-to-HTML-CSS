**UNIT 2- HTML FORMATING**

**HTML SYNTAX**
**HTML has 6 headlines** from h1-h6. H1 is the largest that catchs the attention of the reader, then h6 is the least important and does grab much attention. To emphasize something we use Italics.
To convey a warning or highlight we use Bold words.
**HTM Lists** are important elements, we have 3 types namely ordered,unordered and definition list. Unordered lists is just a list that the order doesnt matter, each element is enclosed in then the list is wrapped to show its unorderd list. Ordered list is whereby the ordered of the list matters. Definition list is used to define terms as the word says. We use a specific tags which are <dt>, <dd> and <dl> (used to wrap). 
**HTML Quotes** are used to format a text as a quote, block quote is used to format large chuncks of text as quote and are usuallly displayed with a different background. Inline quotes format small texts as quote and are displayed with quotation marks. 
**HTML date elements** are used to display date on a web page and we use format that is understood by computer. The value attribute specifies thew date to be displayed. The tag element is used to create a date picker and it can be used to customise the date picker. Time picker allows you to select the time of the day. Using datetime element allows you to combine both time and date ,starting with date and follows time. The datetime can be separated by leaving or T inbetween.
**HTML Code, pre and br**
<br> tag inserts a single line break, it is mostly used in poems and writing addresses. It is an empty tag with no end tag.
pre tag is used to define the preformatted.
**HTML Superscrips, Subscripts&small text**
Superscripts is a text that is raised above the baseline more like an exponent. The tag used to create subscripts is the one lowered beyond the baseline.

**UNIT 3**

**HTML Capabilities**
HTML Attributes always come in name/value. Certain attributes are assigned for specific elements. ID name ensures that there is ony one element with that ID so its easy to use it and link it to Javascript. HTML has so many attributes that can be used to modify the web pages.
